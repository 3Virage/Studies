I think Poland is a pretty strong contender: Going from being a world power with a
 surprisingly democratic system of government in the late middle-ages, to NOT EXISTING 
for 123 years from 1795, to being reborn in the aftermath of WW I, to being overrun by
 Nazi-Germany and Soviet Russia simultaneously, being forced to host the holocaust and, 
afterwards, being turned into a virtual puppet-state under Stalin. And then when communism
 finally fell, the new economic policies were written by Jeffrey Sachs.
The fact that Poles are well known to be good at complaining is hardly surprising.
